# ElderCare

ElderCare is an app designed to allow the elderly to connect with their children. Its aimed at providing children an activity log defining the actions of their elderly family memebers. By allowing children and their elderly family members to communicate and share details, we aim to improve inter-generation solidarity

This app can be of a larger societal benefit when developers continue building the app integrating more services into the activity log, and by integrating features that create value to all users.
